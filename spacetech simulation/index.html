  <h3> Here is some information growing patatoes on mars</h3>
  <p > Plants that are prime candidates for a Mars mission would have very little inedible structure. So far, ten plants that require little room and grow with minimal work have been identified. A few of the ten ideal plants identified are lettuce, spinach, carrots, tomatoes, strawberries, some herbs and cabbage. In The Martian, a stranded NASA astronaut is forced to turn a planned four-week mission on the surface of Mars into a marathon for survival. His only chance to have enough food to last until he's rescued is to turn his habitat into a space farm, using the only crop he has available: potatoes. Martian Potatoes. In order to survive, he, being a botanist, grows potatoes on the parched planet under controlled conditions and actually manages to survive for a long time (he also has vitamin supplements through pills, by the way). Yes, he grows potatoes on Mars. He takes the soil and uses his feces as a fertilizer to make it work. If they grow successfully, the potatoes will then be planted in a simulator that factors in the atmospheric conditions on Mars. Walter Amoros, a Peruvian scientist at the CIP, said he thinks half of the potatoes will grow in the desert soil, but only about 10 will yield a good-sized tuber. The bad news is that Mars is a desert planet, where no plants have ever grown before. In the story, Watneyâ€™s botany skills help him survive the ordeal. He uses the potatoes NASA packed for his Mars expedition along with his own feces and manages to grow potatoes in a small farm inside the Hab.  </p >
